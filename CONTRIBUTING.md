# Contributing to the Quality Demonstration

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Based on the [Eclipse Tractus-X project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.tractusx) we provide a 
technical demonstration for the Manufacturing-X Stack combining:

- Industry 4.0 Components using the Asset Administration Shell
- A Data Space Protocol enabled application (Tractus-X Connector)
- A Decentralized Claims Protocol enabled application (Tractus-X Connector, mocked Credential Service)

It uses the Catena-X quality use case and applies it closer to the Catena-X digital twin and industry core pattern.
It especially ignores mass data transfers.
